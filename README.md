## Summary Statement:

Curious, hard-working computer science and engineering student, with a lifelong passion for learning and experimenting.
I have strengthened my critical thinking skills and expanded my problem-solving skills. I have spent over a year studying
cryptography, risk analysis, application development, and have learned to quickly prototype and build complex
applications in Python and C++. I am prepared to apply my skills in mathematics, computer science, computer
engineering, and cybersecurity to help improve the quality of life for people in my community and country.

## Relevant Experience:

**Senior Engineering Design Project**

**Sponsor:** NovTech, FAU

**Stakeholder:** Dr. Hanqi Zhuang, zhuang@fau.edu

**Job Type:** Student, 10-20 hours per week

**Role:** Team Leader, Python Developer

**Goal:** Find and implement a quantum-safe cryptographic algorithm on an FPGA to demonstrate the usefulness and
feasibility of post-quantum encryption for hardware systems.

**Experience:** Lead a team to develop and implement post-quantum cryptography in Python, C, and on an FPGA. Learned
post-quantum encryption algorithms, the NTRUEncrypt Algorithm, Shor's Algorithm, Technical Reports, communication
with shareholders, Quartus, and basic VHDL and circuit design. The system programmed in Python was capable of
performing polynomial mapping on a user message, generating randomized and invertible polynomials, generating Public
Key, generating Private Key, encrypting, and decrypting.

**Software Engineering Project**

**Job Type:** Student, 5-10 hours per week

**Role:** Team Co-Leader, Front/Back End Developer

**Goal:** Create a social media platform capable of hosting users and allowing them to upload text and pictures to the
platform. Included features such as likes, daily polls, support for rare image types (tiff, WebP, etc.), account creation,
account login, search order.

**Experience:** Lead the team to implement the platform. Learned how to work with an Agile development framework,
including Jira, Github, Git, as well as creating databases with SQL, in-depth use of PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also
learned technical reports, communicating with shareholders and superiors, UML Diagrams, and system design.
